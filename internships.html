        <h1 class="header">Where do I find CS internships?</h1>
        <p class="content">
          There are many ways to find internships, but this guide covers some of
          the most common ways to find them.
        </p>
        <h2>Job Boards</h2>
        <p>
          The most common way I have found internship listings is through job
          posting boards on various sites. The easiest way is to simply search
          for “software engineer internships” or “computer science internships”
          on Google and see what you get from there.
        </p>
        <div>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships/">
                https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships/</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">https://www.indeed.com/ </a>
            </li>

            <li><a href="https://glassdoor.com/">https://glassdoor.com/</a></li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/"
                >https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/"
                >https://joinhandshake.com/</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Although these job boards are great places for finding tons of
          opportunities, they tend to be less effective than other options for
          finding internships.
        </p>
        <h2>Tech Events</h2>
        <p>
          Companies will often try to find potential candidates at tech events
          that they sponsor. For students, this includes conferences,
          hackathons, and other meetups that you can find online and locally.
        </p>
        <p>
          For hackathons, I recommend heading over to either https://mlh.io/ or
          https://devpost.com/ to find a hackathon you may be interested in. Be
          sure to attend the company workshops and try to connect with company
          representatives to gain better access to opportunities. Overall,
          hackathons are great ways of polishing your technical skills while
          connecting with employers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conferences, career fairs, and other meetups can come in a variety of
          forms. One option is to simply search for “[industry] conference” such
          as “artificial intelligence conference” or “cybersecurity conference.”
          There are also conferences geared towards specific groups of people,
          such as the Grace Hopper Celebration, which can be especially
          effective in finding opportunities.
